# BlackJack
A GUI single-player black jack game. Coded in Java, trying to follow object-oriented design principles and more such as MVC. The GUI was created using Java Swing.

Shoutout to professor Mark Paulk at UTD for making me obsess over object-oriented design.
I tried my best to identify objects and create methods that revolve around those objects. I also tried to implement the concepts I learned in his class like low coupling, high cohesion and all that jazz. Made sure my code is decently well documented as I spammed JavaDoc (+ extra) comments everywhere. I should've planned the project more, it would've helped mitigate a lot of the backtracking and revision I had to do. It's not perfect, but I gladly welcome any constructive criticism and feedback. Apologies for it being so amateur though.
Java Swing supremacy by the way, I would never trade it for anything else.
